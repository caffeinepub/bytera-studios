# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the About section stats claims and the footer “Built with caffeine.ai” attribution from the page.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the “5+ / Years Experience” and “50+ / Projects Completed/Clients” statistic blocks from the About section.
- Remove the footer attribution line that says “Built with” and links to “caffeine.ai”.

**User-visible outcome:** The About section no longer shows the “5+” or “50+” stats, and the bottom/footer no longer displays any “Built with caffeine.ai” attribution.
