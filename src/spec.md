# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the landing page Hero primary CTA (“Start Your Project”) render with white, bold text to match the rest of the header/Hero styling.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Hero primary CTA button label styling so “Start Your Project” text is white (#FFFFFF) and remains bold in the default state.
- Ensure hover/focus/active states keep the label readable with sufficient contrast without changing the label text.

**User-visible outcome:** On the landing page Hero section, the “Start Your Project” CTA appears with bold white text and remains readable across interaction states.
