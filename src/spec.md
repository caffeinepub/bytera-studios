# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a small, clear “$50 deposit required” note with brief reasoning under each pricing plan in the Pricing section.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Pricing section UI so each plan card (Basic, Standard, Premium) includes the exact phrase “$50 deposit required”.
- Add one short English sentence explaining the purpose of the deposit (e.g., covering initial work like a website preview/prototype) under or next to the deposit phrase.
- Style the deposit note as visually subordinate (small/muted) but readable in the existing dark theme, keeping layout consistent on mobile and desktop.

**User-visible outcome:** Each pricing plan card shows “$50 deposit required” plus a short explanation, presented in subtle readable text without changing prices, plan names, or features.
